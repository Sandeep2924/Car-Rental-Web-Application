# Car Rental Website

Hey! This project is something I'm really proud of—my very own car rental website built using React and Sass/SCSS. It’s designed to make renting cars simple and efficient. Whether you're looking for a quick ride or something more long-term, this site has got you covered. You can search, compare, and book cars with just a few.

## Built With

- React JS
- Sass / SCSS

# Setting Up the Project

Here’s a quick guide to get it running on your machine. It's straightforward and hassle-free!

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

- Node.js (v12 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Move into the project folder:

   ```
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

To start the development server, run:

```
 npm start
```

Once it’s up, open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Sass Styling

I used Sass for styling to keep things modular and clean. All Sass files are in the `src/styles` folder.
To compile Sass into CSS, run:

```
npm run build-css
```

This will convert all Sass files into CSS and store them in the same folder.

## Extra Scripts

Here are some other scripts you might find handy:

- `npm run test`: Run tests to make sure everything’s working.
- `npm run build`: Prepare the project for production.
- `npm run eject`: Unlink from Create React App (use cautiously).

## Final Thoughts

That’s it! I had a blast building this, and I hope you find it easy to set up. Hit me up if you want to know more or have any feedback!
